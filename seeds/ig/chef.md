# 🔪 Instagram Pivot: The Master Chef
**Goal:** Transform your Explore page into a culinary masterclass in plating, prep, and professional technique.

### 🔗 Phase 1: High-Signal Profile Visits
Visit these profiles and **Save** one technique-heavy reel (e.g., a knife skill demo or a sauce reduction) from each.
* **[@oliviatied](https://www.instagram.com/oliviatied/)** (Private chef focusing on high-level prep and execution)
* **[@halfbakedharvest](https://www.instagram.com/halfbakedharvest/)** (Tieghan Gerard - Styling and complex recipe development)
* **[@gordongram](https://www.instagram.com/gordongram/)** (Gordon Ramsay - Focus on his "Academy" or "Basics" style posts)

### 🛠️ Phase 2: The "Culinary Science" Signal
Search for the hashtag `#foodscience` or `#pastrychef`. Find 3 detailed "how-to" carousel posts and **Save** them to a new collection named "Kitchen Skills."

### 🧹 Phase 3: The "Lazy Food" Scrub
Go to your Explore page. If you see "5-minute mug cakes" or "cheese-drenched fast food" hacks:
1. Long-press the post.
2. Tap **"Not Interested."**
3. We are telling IG we want Michelin-star logic, not viral snacks.
