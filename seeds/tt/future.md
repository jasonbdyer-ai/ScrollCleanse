# 🚀 TikTok Pivot: Future Shock
**Goal:** Train your FYP to be a real-time feed of AI breakthroughs and robotics demos.

### 🔗 Phase 1: High-Signal Follows
Follow these creators. Watch their latest video and **let it loop twice.**
* **[@rowancheung](https://www.tiktok.com/@rowancheung)** - AI news and tool breakthroughs.
* **[@tech_with_william](https://www.tiktok.com/@tech_with_william)** - Futuristic hardware and ecosystem updates.
* **[@nasa](https://www.tiktok.com/@nasa)** - Real-world space progress.

### 🛠️ Phase 2: The "Future" Loop
Search for `#robotics` or `#futuretech`. Pick a video of a robot or a new AI interface and **watch it to the end.** Rewatches are the primary signal that you are "studying" the future.

### 🧹 Phase 3: Immediate Dismissal
The second you see "old tech" or basic consumer gadget reviews, **swipe up instantly.** You want the algorithm to know you only care about the *next* thing, not the *current* thing.
