# 🐶 YouTube Pivot: Golden Retriever
**Goal:** Replace stressful news and "outrage" content with heartwarming animal stories.

### 🔗 Phase 1: The Search Blast
Open these results and watch at least 60 seconds of the top video for each.
* [The Dodo - Heartwarming Rescues](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=the+dodo+dog+rescues)
* [Tucker Budzyn - Golden Retriever Life](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tucker+budzyn)
* [Mayapolarbear - Samoyed Joy](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mayapolarbear)

### 📺 Phase 2: Channel Subscriptions
Subscribe to the 3 "Godfathers" of wholesome YouTube:
1. [The Dodo](https://www.youtube.com/@TheDodo) (The ultimate "feel-good" channel)
2. [Tucker Budzyn](https://www.youtube.com/@TuckerBudzyn) (The King of Golden Retrievers)
3. [Girl With The Dogs](https://www.youtube.com/@GirlWithTheDogs) (Satisfying grooming and happy pets)

### 🧹 Phase 3: The "Shorts" Pivot
Open YouTube Shorts. If the first video isn't an animal, search "Funny Puppies" and watch 10 shorts in a row. This will "force-feed" the algorithm your new preference.
