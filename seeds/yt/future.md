# 🚀 YouTube Pivot: Future Shock
**Goal:** Replace shallow tech reviews with deep dives into AI, Space-X, and the future of humanity.

### 🔗 Phase 1: The Search Blast
Open these results and watch at least 3 minutes of a high-utility video.
* [ColdFusion - The Future of AI](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=coldfusion+ai+future)
* [Starship Launch Progress - Everyday Astronaut](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=everyday+astronaut+starship)
* [Two Minute Papers - AI Research](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=two+minute+papers)

### 📺 Phase 2: Channel Subscriptions
Subscribe to the 3 best "Frontier" channels:
1. [ColdFusion](https://www.youtube.com/@ColdFusion) (Stunningly produced tech history and future trends)
2. [Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/@TwoMinutePapers) (The best way to stay current on AI research)
3. [Everyday Astronaut](https://www.youtube.com/@EverydayAstronaut) (Deep-space engineering made accessible)

### 🧹 Phase 3: The History Scrub
Go to your YouTube history and remove any "Phone Review" or "Gaming Drama" videos. This clears the "General Tech" noise and forces the algorithm to focus on "Frontier Tech."
