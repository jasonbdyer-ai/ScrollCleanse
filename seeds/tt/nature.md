# 🌲 TikTok Pivot: Off-Grid Escape
**Goal:** Train your FYP to provide a "window to the woods" using quiet, skill-based natural content.

### 🔗 Phase 1: High-Signal Follows
Follow these creators. Watch their latest video and **let it loop twice.**
* **[@luxonbushcraft](https://www.tiktok.com/@luxonbushcraft)** - Incredible building projects in the wild.
* **[@victoria.outside](https://www.tiktok.com/@victoria.outside)** - High-skill bushcraft and outdoor cooking.
* **[@theoffgridhomesteader](https://www.tiktok.com/@theoffgridhomesteader)** - Real-world homesteading and garden tips.

### 🛠️ Phase 2: The "Quiet" Loop
Search for `#bushcraft` or `#offgridliving`. Find a video with **no background music** (just natural sounds). Watch it twice. The algorithm interprets this as a preference for "Calm" content.

### 🧹 Phase 3: Immediate Dismissal
The second you see a loud "lifestyle hack" or a fast-paced urban vlog, **swipe up instantly.** You are teaching TikTok that you want a lower "tempo" of content.
