# 🌃 TikTok Pivot: Night Drive
**Goal:** Train your FYP to be a window into cinematic nightscapes and global instrumental discovery.

### 🔗 Phase 1: High-Signal Follows
Follow these creators. Watch their latest video and **let it loop three times.**
* **[@nightdrive_aesthetic](https://www.tiktok.com/@nightdrive_aesthetic)** - Pure cinematic nocturnal vibes.
* **[@vinylcollector](https://www.tiktok.com/@vinylcollector)** - Deep cuts of jazz, funk, and rare global records.
* **[@slowliving.nocturnal](https://www.tiktok.com/@slowliving.nocturnal)** - Atmospheric nightscapes.

### 🛠️ Phase 2: The "Global Groove" Loop
Search for `#citypop` or `#nu-jazz`. Pick a video with a smooth instrumental track and **Favorite** it. The algorithm recognizes this as a preference for "Background/Atmospheric" audio.

### 🧹 Phase 3: The Instant Silence
If a video starts with a loud trending "shouting" sound or high-BPM dance music, **swipe up instantly.** You are teaching TikTok that you want the "Chill" side of the app.
