# ScrollCleanse

"Your attention is your most valuable asset. Stop letting bad algorithms waste it."

This is an open-source toolkit designed to help you break free from "algorithmic ruts." Whether you are stuck in a doomscrolling loop, outgrown old interests, or just want a "digital palate cleanser," this guide provides the steps to pivot your feeds with intentionality.

🛠 The 3-Step Workflow

Step 1: The Clean Slate (The Scrub) 🧹
Before planting new seeds, you must clear the "mud" from your canvas. Use these direct links to reset your platform history.

Step 2: Choose Your "Interest Seed" (The Pivot) 🌱
Now that your feed is empty, tell the algorithm what you actually care about. Choose ONE of the seeds below and follow the instructions inside.

🐶 Golden Retriever - Pure wholesome joy. Best for stress relief.

🚀 Founder Mode - Startups, SaaS, and Building. Best for productivity.

🎓 Open Yale - Academic deep-dives and lectures. Best for learning.

🧘 Stoic Fortress - Resilience and philosophy. Best for mental health.

🍳 Cyber-Chef - High-skill culinary arts. Best for hobbyists.

Step 3: Guard Your Feed (The Maintenance) 🛡️
Algorithms are like gardens—they need weeding.

The "Not Interested" Rule: For the first 48 hours after a reset, be aggressive. If a video pops up that doesn't fit your new vibe, hit "Not Interested" immediately.

Search is a Signal: Every time you search for something, you are "voting" for what you want to see. Use it wisely.

Weekly Check-ins: Run a "mini-scrub" once a week to keep the noise away.
