# 🔪 YouTube Pivot: The Master Chef
**Goal:** Replace entertainment-only food content with fundamental culinary education.

### 🔗 Phase 1: The Search Blast
Open these results and watch at least 3 minutes of a high-utility video (Basics or Science focus).
* [Basics with Babish - Knife Skills](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=basics+with+babish+knife+skills)
* [J. Kenji López-Alt - POV Cooking](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kenji+lopez+alt+cooking)
* [Ethan Chlebowski - Food Science](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ethan+chlebowski+food+science)

### 📺 Phase 2: Channel Subscriptions
Subscribe to the channels that explain the *why* behind the cooking:
1. [Babish Culinary Universe](https://www.youtube.com/@babishculinaryuniverse) (Start with the 'Basics' series)
2. [J. Kenji López-Alt](https://www.youtube.com/@kenjilopezalt) (The master of home-kitchen science)
3. [Ethan Chlebowski](https://www.youtube.com/@EthanChlebowski) (Deep dives into ingredients and processes)

### 🧹 Phase 3: The "Recipe Junk" Cleanup
Clear your YouTube search history of any "viral food" or "mukbang" searches. This stops the algorithm from pulling you back into "spectator" mode.
